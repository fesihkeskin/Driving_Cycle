# Driving Cycle

Welcome to the repository for our paper, "[A Data-Driven Framework for Driving Cycle Generation and Analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981241260700)" Here, we present a novel methodology combining Markov chain modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, and Dynamic Time Warping to generate realistic driving cycles, specifically tailored for the unique traffic conditions of [Igdir, Turkey](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/39.9216343,44.0418135/39.9200546,44.0435517/39.9225889,44.0442167/39.9337557,44.0489844/39.9375393,44.079913/39.9372601,44.0802923/39.9043953,44.0609652/39.9193395,44.0416492/@39.9206967,44.0585684,14z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu). Explore our code and datasets to see how we accurately model driving patterns to aid in sustainable mobility solutions.

## Features

## Dataset
The dataset provided in this repository consists of 19 driving cycles collected from the city of [Igdir, Turkey](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/39.9216343,44.0418135/39.9200546,44.0435517/39.9225889,44.0442167/39.9337557,44.0489844/39.9375393,44.079913/39.9372601,44.0802923/39.9043953,44.0609652/39.9193395,44.0416492/@39.9206967,44.0585684,14z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu). The driving cycles were recorded using an [On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) device installed in a 5-door vehicle. The data was acquired onboard using an Android device.
 
The driving cycles cover a route of approximately 11,150 meters, including two main arteries (D080 and E99 international trade routes) connecting Turkey to Asian countries. The dataset includes driving cycles during both peak and off-peak hours, as well as on weekdays and weekends, to reflect a variety of driving situations under diverse traffic congestion scenarios.

## Accessing the Data
To access the data, simply download the txt files available in the "[Data](https://github.com/fesihkeskin/Driving_Cycle/tree/main/Data)" folder of this repository. The txt files contain time-speed profiles for each driving cycle, providing detailed temporal information about velocities, vehicle acceleration/deceleration parameters.

## Running the Code
The code provided in this repository implements a data-driven framework for the generation and analysis of realistic driving cycles.
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the code comments to input the necessary parameters and paths to the data files.
3. For MATLAB <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="MATLAB Logo" height="20"> </a>
   1. Set the data folder path
   2. Run "[main.m](https://github.com/fesihkeskin/Driving_Cycle/blob/main/main.m)"
4. For Python: <a href="https://www.python.org/"> <img src="https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg" alt="Python Logo" height="20"> </a>
   1. Set the data folder path
   2. In Google Colab <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" alt="Google Colab"  height="20"> </a>, Jupyter Notebook <a href="https://jupyter.org/"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Jupyter_logo.svg/1200px-Jupyter_logo.svg.png" alt="Jupyter Notebook" height="20"> </a>, etc., upload provided "[driving_cycle.ipynb](https://github.com/fesihkeskin/Driving_Cycle/blob/main/driving_cycle.ipynb)" file and run the notebook cells.
* Note that in this study, segmentation is based on road characteristics. Segment sizes are given in the data folder as the "[segment_sizes.mat](https://github.com/fesihkeskin/Driving_Cycle/blob/main/Data/segment_sizes.mat)" file. You can get different segment sizes by using different segmentation methods in your own work.
