# Driving_Cycle

Driving_Cycle is a data-driven framework for generating and analyzing realistic driving cycles. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to implement the framework and utilize its features.

**Please note that the proposed method of code provided in this repository is currently under review for publication.**

## Features

-   Generation of realistic driving cycles using advanced techniques
-   Incorporation of Markov chain modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and DTW
-   Accurate representation of the complexity and stochastic nature of real-world driving behavior
