# Driving_Cycle

Driving_Cycle is a data-driven framework for generating and analyzing realistic driving cycles. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to implement the framework and utilize its features.

**Please note that the proposed method of code provided in this repository is currently under review for publication.**

## Features

-   Generation of realistic driving cycles using advanced techniques
-   Incorporation of Markov chain modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and DTW
-   Accurate representation of the complexity and stochastic nature of real-world driving behavior

## Dataset
The dataset provided in this repository consists of 19 driving cycles collected from the city of Igdir, Turkey. The driving cycles were recorded using an On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) device installed in a 5-door vehicle. The data was acquired onboard using an Android device.

The driving cycles cover a route of approximately 11,150 meters, including two main arteries (D080 and E99 international trade routes) connecting Turkey to Asian countries. The dataset includes driving cycles during both peak and off-peak hours, as well as on weekdays and weekends, to reflect a variety of driving situations under diverse traffic congestion scenarios.

## Accessing the Dataset
To access the dataset, simply download the txt files available in the "Data" folder of this repository. The txt files contain time-speed profiles for each driving cycle, providing detailed temporal information about velocities, vehicle acceleration/deceleration parameters.

## Code
The code provided in this repository implements a data-driven framework for the generation and analysis of realistic driving cycles.

## Prerequisites
To run the code, you will need Python with the necessary libraries installed. The required libraries for Python can be found in the "requirements.txt" file.

Usage

You are free to use this dataset for research, analysis, and development purposes. Please cite the source of the dataset in your work to acknowledge its origin.
