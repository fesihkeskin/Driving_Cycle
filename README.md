# Driving_Cycle

Driving_Cycle is a data-driven framework for generating and analyzing realistic driving cycles. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to implement the framework and utilize its features.

**Please note that the proposed method of code provided in this repository is currently under review for publication.**

## Features

-   Generation of realistic driving cycles using advanced techniques
-   Incorporation of Markov chain modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and DTW
-   Accurate representation of the complexity and stochastic nature of real-world driving behavior

## Dataset
The dataset provided in this repository consists of 19 driving cycles collected from the city of Igdir, Turkey. The driving cycles were recorded using an On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) device installed in a 5-door vehicle. The data was acquired onboard using an Android device.

The driving cycles cover a route of approximately 11,150 meters, including two main arteries (D080 and E99 international trade routes) connecting Turkey to Asian countries. The dataset includes driving cycles during both peak and off-peak hours, as well as on weekdays and weekends, to reflect a variety of driving situations under diverse traffic congestion scenarios.

## Accessing the Dataset
To access the dataset, simply download the txt files available in the "Data" folder of this repository. The txt files contain time-speed profiles for each driving cycle, providing detailed temporal information about velocities, vehicle acceleration/deceleration parameters.

## Code
The code provided in this repository implements a data-driven framework for the generation and analysis of realistic driving cycles.

## Prerequisites
- To run the code, you will need Python with the necessary libraries installed. The required libraries for Python can be found in the "requirements.txt" file.
- MATLAB R2012a or later is required to run the MATLAB version (main.m) of the code.
